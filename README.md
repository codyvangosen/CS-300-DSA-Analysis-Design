# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-Design
This repository includes my final portfolio for my SNHU course of CS 300 DSA Analysis &amp; Design.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The tasks presented within the project for this course centered around a central problem of providing detailed analysis of runtimes for code implementations to print a course schedule with its required prerequisite courses. The Big O analysis provided a great level of insight into the efficiency of the various data structures. The pseudocode created during Project One provided an excellent rough framework and programming mindset for the full implementation of the solution for Project Two.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures provide structured and standardized methods for sharing and holding various forms of information in many different situations. Each data structure has its own set of pros and cons related to efficiency or other benefits each might confer. Understanding the best or most practical data structure for various use cases helps to facilitate more efficient programming and problem-solving. The adaptability afforded by understanding each of the various common data structures is paramount to efficient programming.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The class textbook suggested supplementary reading materials, and a combination of personal research on stack overflow all proved very useful in overcoming roadblocks as they presented themselves. This coupled with the set-it-and-forget-it approach helped to overcome many of the major issues faced during program implementation. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
