# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-Design
This repository includes my final portfolio for my SNHU course of CS 300 DSA Analysis &amp; Design.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The tasks presented within the project for this course centered around a central problem of providing detailed anlasyis of runtimes for code implmentations to print a course schedule with its required prerequisite courses. The Big O analysis provided a great level of insight into the efficiency of the various data strucutres. While the pseudocde created during project one provided an excellent rough framework and programming mindset for the full implmentation of the solution for project two.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures provided structured and standardized methods for sharing and holding various forms of information in many different situations. Each data structure has its own set of pros and cons related to efficiency or other benefits each might confer. Understanding the best or most practical data structure for various use cases helps to facilitate more efficent programming and problem solving. The adaptibility afforded by understanding each of the various common data structures is paramount to efficient programming.
